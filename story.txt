  HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - Summer is upon us and that means we are now embarking on the Outrigger Canoe paddling's regatta season. Amy Kalili has more with some cultural and historical context on this Hawaiian sport that helps us maintain a healthy active lifestyle as we perpetuate our Hawaiian traditions. 
 Aloha kauwela e ko Hawaiʻi. Ua pili no ka nui o kakou i ka hoewaʻa ma kekahi ʻano, ina ma ke komo kino a i ʻole me ke kakoʻo i na hoa a ʻohana paha. 
 Most of us in Hawaiʻi have had some kind of exposure to paddling, personally or through supporting friends and family! 
 It's a great hawaiian sport. 
 You can come out and paddle and you get hooked on it and you gonna paddle for a long time because it's such a comfortable sport to be on the water with 5 other people.

 Hui Hoewaʻa ʻo Ânuenue 
 He haʻuki Hawaiʻi no hoʻi. Hei ʻia no ka poʻe i ka ʻoluʻolu a me ka launa kanaka ma ka poʻaiapili honukai. 
 He poʻaiaili ʻoluʻolu a he hana kuʻuna Hawaiʻi no hoʻi, i loko hoʻi o ka nui loli i ʻike ʻia ma ka holo o na makahiki. 
 It's fun and it's traditionally Hawaiian, despite the changes over the years. 
 He mea koʻikoʻi ka hoewaʻa iaʻu no ka mea, ʻo ia ko makou pilina i ka wa kahiko. He mea e hoʻohanohano i na kupuna o Hawaiʻi nei.

 Hoe Waʻa, Hui Lanakila 
 It's our connection to the past, honoring our heritage. 
 When I was young, you know, you jump in the canoe, go fish little bit.

 Haku, Hui Hoewaʻa ʻo Ânuenue 
 Ma mua, he nanea, he holoholo kai. 
 ʻAʻole i pili i ka heihei wale no. He kiʻina hoʻolako meaʻai a he alakau no hoʻi. 
 It wasn't about racing. It was a means for getting food and getting around. 
 ʻO kçla kekahi ʻano o ka poʻe Hawaiʻi i hele i na ʻano wahi like ʻole. 
 Kaleo Martinez 
 Hoe Waʻa, Hui Lanakila 
 It was a means to go here and there. 
 Ma muli o ke kalele ʻia o ka heihei ʻana, ua loli ke kaila o ka hoe ʻana a me na pono hoe waʻa kekahi. 
 Because of the focus on racing, the styles and equipment have changed too. 
 Before you know that paddles were real this high you know, big blades. Now the paddles are about and real, paper light. 
 There were no t-tops. 
 Geez the canoes were 600 pounds. 
 (Nappy) 
 Ma mua, loʻihi loa na ʻau, laula na palaulau. Mama loa i kçia manawa. 
 (Babes) 
 ʻAʻohe pakuʻina o luna ma mua.  
 (Nappy) 
 Ma kahi o ka 600 paona o ka waʻa! 
 Mau no naʻe ka nani o kçia poʻaiapili i wahi e launa ai ka ʻohana a malama ʻia ai ka pilina o na hanauna ma ka hana Hawaiʻi. 
 It's still a great family environment and place of intergenerational learning. 
 Ua hoewa'a ko'u 'ohana mai ka manawa loʻihi loa. 
 …koʻu tutu wahine mai kona wa kamaliʻi 
 me koʻu makuakane mai kona wa ʻopio. 
 (Kauʻi martinez) 
 My whole family, including my grandma and dad, has paddled since childhood! 
 Ua hoewa'a au no 10 makahiki, mai ka papa 7. 
 mai ke kula kaiapuni ʻo Ânuenue. No laila, he mea nui kçla no makou no ka mea kula Hawaiʻi makou a he haʻuki Hawaiʻi (cut from 0106398…010640,06) ʻO ia ke kumu he mea nui noʻu mai ka wa ʻopio. 
 I paddled since 7 th  grade at Ânuenue immerson school. It was our Hawaiian sport at this Hawaiian school and it's always been a part of my life. 
 A loaʻa pu kekahi kumu ahuwale e komo nui ai ka poʻe i ka hoewaʻa ʻana.  
 And of course, there's another reason many get into paddling. 
 Maikaʻi ka hoʻoikaika kino. 
 Leʻaleʻa noʻu a me koʻu mau hoaaloha (clean up the space here) ka hoʻoikaika kino. 
 It's great exercise!

 Senior Women, Hui Lanakila 
 We enjoy it! 
 He mea nui ka hoe waʻa ʻana noʻu no ka mea ʻo kçla kekahi hauki o ka wa kahiko. 
 He hana Hawaiʻi hiki ke hoʻomau. 
 It's our traditional Hawaiian sport and one we should perpetuate. 
 No laila, i kau hoewaʻa maikaʻi ia ʻoukou e ko Hawaiʻi mau hoewaʻa a no ka poʻe i komo ʻole i kçia kauwela, e noʻonoʻo hou no kçia kau aʻe! 
 A great season to all paddlers and for others, think it about for next summer!
